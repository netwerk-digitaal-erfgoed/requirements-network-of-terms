Introduction {#intro}
=====================

How can users find heritage information, regardless of the institutions that manage this information?
This will only work if institutions use the same terms to describe the same information.
These terms come from common terminology sources such as thesauri and reference lists.

Nevertheless, it can be a challenge for institutions to use terminology sources:
sources have different ways of making their terms accessible, for example with regard to search options, metadata schemes and interfaces.
This variety makes them difficult to use.
The Network of Terms wants to offer a solution for this by offering a uniform way of searching in terminology sources, both functionally and technically.

The Network of Terms is a so-called generic facility, a facility that is standardized and supports the network of digital heritage.
In addition, the Network of Terms is a distributed facility, a facility that is not centrally provided by a manager, but decentralized by various managers.
The "Network of Terms" is therefore an umbrella term to designate all instances â€“ all "networks of terms".

This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements that the Network of Terms must meet.
The purpose of the requirements is to make the Network of Terms as useful as possible for users,
usually collection managers of institutions and suppliers of their collection management software.

The requirements have been drawn up by the project [Standardized terms in the network](https://www.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/en/activities/usable-digital-heritage/standardized-terms/).
The project is part of the 2019-2020 intensification program of the Dutch Digital Heritage Network.
The requirements take the [Digital Heritage Reference Architecture 3.0](https://dera.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/) as a starting point.
The requirements are a deepening of DERA and can supplement a future version of it.

    Include a glossary of terms and their definitions. This is preferably a separate document that can also be used
     by other documents, such as the [[!NDE-DATASETS|Requirements for Datasets]].

Audience {#audience}
--------------------

The requirements are intended for everyone involved in implementing and making available the Network of Terms,
such as developers and administrators.

Prioritization of requirements {#prioritization}
============

Each requirement has a priority. The priority follows the [MoSCoW method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method):

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Priority</th>
            <th>Explanation</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Must have</td>
            <td>The requirement is necessary</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Should have</td>
            <td>The requirement is important, but not necessary<td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Could have</td>
            <td>The requirement is desired, but not important<td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Would have</td>
            <td>The requirement is interesting, but not desired now<td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Requirements {#requirements}
============

The requirements are both functional and non-functional.
The functional requirements make clear which functionality the Network of Terms must offer in order to be used by users and administrators.
Non-functional requirements describe how the Network of Terms must fulfill the functional requirements.
The non-functional requirements are primarily intended for the IT specialists who will build the Network of Terms
and the IT specialists who will implement the Network of Terms in users' systems, such as collection management systems.
